        ## Link Preview

        You can have the WhatsApp client attempt to render a preview of the first URL in the body text string, if it
        contains one. URLs must begin with http:// or https://. If multiple URLs are in the body text string, only the
        first URL will be rendered.

        <Note>If omitted, or if unable to retrieve a link preview, a clickable link will be rendered instead.</Note>
